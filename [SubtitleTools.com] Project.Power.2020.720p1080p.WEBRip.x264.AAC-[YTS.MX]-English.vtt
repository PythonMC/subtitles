Tracy.

00:42:26.958 --> 00:42:27.791
Baby.

00:42:29.083 --> 00:42:30.541
It's so good to see you.

00:42:32.708 --> 00:42:34.000
What? What?

00:42:34.083 --> 00:42:37.875
[beeping]

00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:39.000

What's that?

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.500
They're logging Powers.
There's chips in every capsule.

00:43:02.166 --> 00:43:04.916
The government won't let them test it,
so they test it on us.

00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:07.875
The people that you're selling to,

00:43:09.333 --> 00:43:10.500
they're the lab rats.

-[beeping]
-[Robin] What's all that?

00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:17.166
[man]
It's a demonstration for potential buyers.

00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:20.791
It means they're done with New Orleans.
It means I'm running out of time.

00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:31.041
-I gotta go there.
-[tone sounding]

00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:32.333
You gotta take me there.

Help!

00:44:15.208 --> 00:44:16.041

[man] Robin, I need...

00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:08.291
Please.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.041
You killed my cousin.

00:45:13.958 --> 00:45:16.125
He ODed. I didn't kill him.

00:45:22.375 --> 00:45:23.208
I got money.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:25.583
Please.

00:45:27.666 --> 00:45:30.666
I'm just trying--
I'm just trying to find my daughter.

Yo, chill.

00:46:03.083 --> 00:46:04.458
Yo, you need to calm down.

00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:07.875
You fell out, I brought you to the vet.
My mom work here.

You did this?

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:18.541
Yeah.

00:46:19.416 --> 00:46:21.166
But now I need to finish the exit wound.

00:46:22.041 --> 00:46:23.500
You gonna let me do it or not?

00:46:31.083 --> 00:46:32.166
I guess that's a yes.

00:46:33.208 --> 00:46:34.875
[tools clattering]

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:37.875

What?

00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:40.625
Y'all work on humans?

00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:41.875
Nope.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.333
[man grunts] Ah.

00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:46.833
I didn't even do nothing yet.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.250
[woman] There a lot of girls
that look just like her!

00:47:13.333 --> 00:47:16.291
[man] Mrs. Reilly, do you want
your daughter to end up dead?

00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:18.791
I already told you,
I don't know where she is.

00:47:19.208 --> 00:47:21.416
She was supposed to be home hours ago.
What...

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.666
With all due respect, officer,
there's a lot of girls--

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:24.583
[slams gun down]

00:47:24.666 --> 00:47:26.583
[man] This could get very ugly
for your daughter

00:47:26.666 --> 00:47:28.625
-and for you.
-[woman] Are you sure it was her?

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.041
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:47.583
[man] Are you sure
you haven't seen this man before?

00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:50.250
[woman] No, I told you I don't know
what you talking about.

00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:51.375
[man] That's funny.

00:47:51.458 --> 00:47:55.000
We have surveillance footage
of your daughter with this man tonight

00:47:55.083 --> 00:47:56.958
committing crimes
about five miles from here.

00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:58.000
Are you sure?

00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:00.791
This could get a whole lot uglier for you.

00:48:00.875 --> 00:48:03.791
Honey, bear. Are we all out
of that one hippie shampoo that--

00:48:03.875 --> 00:48:06.291
Whoa! What the shit's going on here?
Who the hell are you guys?

00:48:06.375 --> 00:48:07.625
What you doing in my bathroom?

00:48:07.708 --> 00:48:10.083
-[man] We're the police. Who are you?
-Man, I live here.

00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:13.375
Babe, I'm sorry I was in your shower.
The pressure's so much better in yours.

00:48:13.458 --> 00:48:14.500
Can you come over here?

00:48:14.583 --> 00:48:16.666
I'm really sorry
it had to happen that way.

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:17.666
Robin sent me.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:19.666
Let me just handle these guys, okay?

00:48:20.375 --> 00:48:21.375
Officers.

00:48:21.958 --> 00:48:23.958
What precinct
did you guys say you're from?

00:48:24.041 --> 00:48:24.875
They didn't say.

00:48:24.958 --> 00:48:26.708
Sir, Mrs. Reilly and her daughter

00:48:26.791 --> 00:48:29.333
seem to be the only residents
registered to this address.

00:48:29.416 --> 00:48:30.291
I see.

00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:33.708
So now because I'm not
in your little database, I can't...

00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:35.708
-[sneezes]
-Bless you.

00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:37.125
-[sneezes]
-Is there a cat in here?

00:48:37.583 --> 00:48:39.333
I thought you said you lived here.

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:40.916
-[cat meows]
-Yes, I do, sir.

00:48:41.666 --> 00:48:43.416
Is that so hard to believe? Why?

00:48:43.958 --> 00:48:45.375
Is it because I'm white?

00:48:45.458 --> 00:48:47.708
Are you assuming
that me and this beautiful Black woman

00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.416
wouldn't be able to share a happy home?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.750
You wanna say that on camera?

00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:52.500
-Babe, where's your phone?
-Got it.

00:48:52.583 --> 00:48:54.500
All right.
Well, let's just see about this.

00:48:54.583 --> 00:48:56.458
-And we are live streaming.
-[phone beeps]

00:48:56.541 --> 00:48:57.916
Now, let's just get this on record.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.041
Honey, did either of these men
show you a warrant

00:49:00.125 --> 00:49:01.625
when they came into our house?

00:49:01.708 --> 00:49:02.958
No, they did not.

00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:05.416
Uh-huh. And did either of them
show you a badge?

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.125
No! Can I see your badges?

00:49:07.791 --> 00:49:08.625
Gentlemen.

00:49:08.708 --> 00:49:10.458
Thank you for your time, Mrs. Reilly.

00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:13.541
[door opens]

[door closes]

00:49:16.833 --> 00:49:18.208
[woman] I'm sorry, do I know you?

00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:19.416
You got any duct tape?

00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:21.750
Duct tape? What?

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.166
Stop! Who are you?

00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:27.708
My name is Detective Frank Shaver, NOPD.

00:49:27.791 --> 00:49:29.208
Can I see your badge?

00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:30.791
Well, I don't have it on me.

00:49:32.083 --> 00:49:33.041
Where do you have it?

00:49:33.125 --> 00:49:35.666
Mrs. Reilly, your daughter and I
have had a professional friendship

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.375
for a little over half a year now.

00:49:37.458 --> 00:49:39.666
She's a very smart
and good-hearted young person,

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:41.833
but she is mixed up in some things
she shouldn't be,

00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:43.375
and I am trying to help her.

00:49:47.083 --> 00:49:48.625
Thank you. I'm gonna need this too.

00:49:48.708 --> 00:49:49.791
Where's yours?

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:06.166
[man] So what's your power?

00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:07.625
I don't even know.

00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:10.041
Come on. You ain't tried it?

00:50:10.125 --> 00:50:11.041
Honestly...

00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:13.541
I saw a girl OD.

00:50:14.291 --> 00:50:15.416
You know, on the streets,

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.541
they're talking about
how it'll give you superpowers,

00:50:17.625 --> 00:50:19.416
but not about
how one hit could kill you.

00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:21.291
Yeah.

00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:23.875
Well, if you’re so spooked,

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:26.666
why you still in the game?

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:29.708
What happened to getting good grades
and staying in school?

00:50:29.791 --> 00:50:31.750
Yo, I wish I could get good grades.

00:50:32.375 --> 00:50:35.583
Go to school, get to college,
get some fancy-ass job.

00:50:35.666 --> 00:50:37.208
But I need money now.

00:50:37.291 --> 00:50:38.583
Everybody need money now.

00:50:38.666 --> 00:50:41.125
Well, my mother has diabetes now.

00:50:41.208 --> 00:50:43.041
And we don't got no health insurance.

00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:46.416
And she needs surgery, the expensive kind,
so what else am I supposed to do?

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.666
Oh, that's easy.

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:49.250
-What?
-Go to the Army.

00:50:51.458 --> 00:50:54.458
-What, it don't trip you up killing fools?
-Yeah, it tripped me up.

00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:55.916
But that was my skill set.

00:50:57.375 --> 00:50:59.750
And what did the system do?
It took advantage of me.

00:51:00.375 --> 00:51:03.791
But I know now I got to work the system
harder than it's working me.

00:51:05.083 --> 00:51:06.541
That's what you gotta do.

00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:09.750
You're young, you're Black,
you're a woman.

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:12.875
The system is designed
to swallow you whole.

00:51:13.833 --> 00:51:17.125
You gotta find out what you do
better than anybody else and rock that.

00:51:19.458 --> 00:51:21.208
So what you gonna do? Hmm?

00:51:21.958 --> 00:51:23.416
How you gonna leave your mark?

00:51:24.208 --> 00:51:25.041
I rap.

00:51:27.625 --> 00:51:28.500
[snickers]

00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:32.000
Oh.

00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:34.583
I'm sorry.
Well, what's your rap name then, huh?

00:51:34.666 --> 00:51:36.833
What you gonna be, the next Cardi B?

00:51:36.916 --> 00:51:38.083
Huh? Cardi C?

00:51:38.833 --> 00:51:40.541
Well, go ahead and spit then.

00:51:40.625 --> 00:51:42.541
You say you rap, let me hear one line.

00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:45.625
Huh? You can't spit one line?

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:48.416
I don't like doing it in front of people.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.500
How you gonna to be a rapper
if you got stage fright?

00:51:51.458 --> 00:51:54.250
You know what I think? Most time,
people don't wanna do something

00:51:54.333 --> 00:51:56.250
is 'cause they're probably just wack
at it.

00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:58.000
If you wack, just say you wack.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:00.375
Fine, give me a word.

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.833
Give you a word? What you talking about?

00:52:02.916 --> 00:52:04.833
[Robin]
I'm gonna go off the top, give me a word.

00:52:04.916 --> 00:52:06.083
Oh, you that good, huh?

let's call them clinical trials.

01:00:40.291 --> 01:00:41.666
Our footprint is small,

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.375
and we move on quickly
to avoid unwanted oversight.

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:46.166
Our goal is simple.

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.000
The next evolution of the human species.

01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.041
That's where you come in.

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:56.708
<i>With your financing, Teleios could become</i>

What's in it for you?

01:01:01.833 --> 01:01:02.916
It's in the headline.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.833
Power.

01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:06.958
Power to level the playing field.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:09.708
Or, if you like, destroy it entirely.

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.083
Power to create chaos.

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:15.500
Power to renegotiate your reality.

01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:17.500
One day, you won't even need a pill.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:19.333
Pretty words.

01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:21.666
Be more specific.

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:22.666
[whirring]

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:27.583
Sure. Let me tell you
about my friend the little lizard.

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:33.458
A healer who can stitch himself up
and even regrow what he lost.

01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:38.083
Hands, feet, eyes,
unfathomably complex structures.

01:01:38.791 --> 01:01:42.833
The octopus camouflages herself
against the sea floor.

01:01:43.416 --> 01:01:47.083
The wolverine frog breaks its own bones
to use as weapons.

01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:50.208
They see in the dark,
they dislocate their bones.

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:52.041
They turn water into plasma.

01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:55.916
They punch, they strangle,
they thermoregulate.

01:01:56.458 --> 01:02:00.333
Evolution has given animals
countless abilities we can only dream of.

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:03.166
So much power, <i>por favor.</i>

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.958
All the genetic potential
hidden in our DNA

01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:07.916
just waiting to be released.

[whirring]

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.458
With your investment,

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:12.791
one day, a pill that lasts forever.

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:15.875
Stop wishing.

01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:17.166
Start doing.

01:02:18.666 --> 01:02:21.208
Find your power.

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:25.083
[in Spanish] And the death factor?

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:27.250
[in English] Yes, well...

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.291
Results may vary.

01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:33.875
But as we work to a compound
that we fully control,

01:02:35.083 --> 01:02:36.000
we have the tank.

[car horn blaring]

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:44.250
What you doing here?

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:46.000
Looking for you. Your mom is worried sick.

01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:48.416
-Is she okay?
-Yes, she's okay.

01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:50.250
Where's he?

01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:52.958
I don't know.

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.208
Listen, don't bullshit me right now.

01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:57.000
-I'm not.
-Are you protecting him?

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:58.416
-No.
-Why are you protecting--

01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.625
This is a bad guy.

01:03:00.083 --> 01:03:02.666
Why is he a bad guy?
Because he's done some bad things?

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.458
What about you? You do bad things too!

01:03:04.541 --> 01:03:07.666
That is almost a good point,
but the bad things that I have done--

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.416
He's just looking for his daughter.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.833
Everything he's doing,
he's doing it for her.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:14.375
-That sound like a bad guy to you?
-That's what he told you?

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.166
That's what I know.

01:03:19.916 --> 01:03:21.541
Look, I'm sorry that you miss your dad,

01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:23.750
-but he's telling you a story--
-Don't do me like that--

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.208
He's not here looking for his daughter.
He's setting up shop.

01:03:26.708 --> 01:03:28.583
-You think he's the source of Power?
-Yes!

01:03:28.666 --> 01:03:30.541
Well, he's not. He's trying to stop it.

01:03:30.625 --> 01:03:33.583
Uh-huh. Okay. If that's true,
and by the way, I don't think it is,

01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:35.458
but if it is,
then he should be helping me.

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:38.208
If it's not true, then he's lying to you
and he's dangerous

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:41.541
and I need to bring him in. Either way,
you should tell me where he is.

01:03:43.375 --> 01:03:47.125
[man] Ladies, gentlemen,

You're about to witness a very rare power.

Thermoregulation.

This one can get a bit intense.

She said every moment
comes with invisible decisions.

01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:52.875
She told me to tell you about mine rats
and seismographs...

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:54.833
Man it was long.
It was about decisions,

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:56.875
but in the end she said, "Am I lying?"

-[Robin] Frank, we gotta help him.
-[Frank] You already did help him.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.166
You brought him here.
Are you not paying attention?

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.250
He's using you.

What, and you don't?

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:25.833
At least he's being honest about it.

01:11:25.916 --> 01:11:28.083
Come on. Art, tell him what you told me.

01:11:28.166 --> 01:11:29.041
Go home.

Uh-huh. Let me guess, you're one
of the good drug dealers, right?

You're trying to save the world.

You're the one in handcuffs,

so what am I missing?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.458
What you're missing is

01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:12.333
in the next 30 seconds,
your captain is gonna call you

01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:14.833
and tell you to take me
to a different place, not the precinct.

[railway crossing dinging]

[Frank] Oh yeah? Why is that?

01:13:22.583 --> 01:13:24.041

Testing in New Orleans.

01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:28.250
Why?

Local authorities on payroll.

01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:32.666
Why?

01:13:32.916 --> 01:13:35.583
And then your captain
sends out a single cop

01:13:35.666 --> 01:13:39.333
to apprehend the most dangerous man
in the city. Why?

[phone buzzes]

01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:54.500
Because he's taking orders
from someone else.

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:07.708
And I can also tell you
that that van over there...

01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:14.333
This what's gonna happen.

They gonna kill you,
and then they gonna take me.

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:19.541
Now, I'm okay
with that second part of this

01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:21.833
if it gets me to my daughter sooner.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.291
-What are they doing here?
-Doing field testing.

01:14:24.375 --> 01:14:27.125
If they can stabilize it,
then they'll mass produce it.

01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:31.583
So whatever's happening here
is gonna start happening everywhere.

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:35.041
And what?
Your kid has something to do with it?

It's my city.

01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:55.458
They think they can just test their shit
on the people of New Orleans

01:14:55.541 --> 01:14:57.708
and no one's gonna care,
no one's gonna fight them on it?

What do you need?

No, it was his plan. It's the only way
he can get to his daughter.

-Now I gotta bust in after him.

You got a few guards with guns

Yeah, thanks.

in the process.
